QUESTION:
    I wonder if the people who survived the titanic paid higher fares than the people who died?

ANSWER:
    Median fare for people who died: $10.50
    Median fare for people who survived: $26.00
    Clearly the people who had better financial statuses were more likely to survive than those who did not.


QUESTION:
    I wonder if the people who survived the titanic were moreso in the upper class?

ANSWER:
    First Class Survivors: 136
    Second Class Survivors: 87
    Third Class Survivors: 119
    Conclusion: There does not appear to be a corolation between class and survival rate.

QUESTION:
    Since they let women and children board the life boats first, I wonder if the amount of women survivors were much more than men?

ANSWER:
    Men Survivors (above the age of 18): 69
    Women and children survivors: 372
    
    Total Men on Board: 382
    Total Women and Children on Board: 453

    Men who survived: %18
    Women and children who survived: %82

    Conclusion: There was certainly a higher survival rate for women and children than there were for men.
